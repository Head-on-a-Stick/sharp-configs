.SH NAME
sharp-user-setup \- manual page for sharp-user-setup 10.3.7
.SH DESCRIPTION
sharp\-user\-setup version 10.3.7
.PP
sharp\-user\-setup is a script to populate a new user's home directory
using template files from /usr/share/sharpbang/skel/.
.PP
Normally this script is run automatically on a user's first login and
inhibited after that by a flag file at ~/.config/sharpbang/sharp\-setup
.PP
It can, however, be run again by a user to update their config files
from a new version of sharp\-configs. In this case backups will be made
of any files which are overwritten.
.PP
If the user has already made extensive changes to their config files it would
be better to copy in new settings from /usr/share/sharpbang/skel/ by hand.
