.SH NAME
sharp-user-setup \- configure a simple Debian desktop
.SH DESCRIPTION
sharp\-user\-setup: a script to populate a new user's HOME directory
using template files from /usr/share/sharpbang/skel
.PP
Normally this script is run automatically on a user's first login,
and inhibited after that by a flag file:
~/.config/sharpbang/sharp\-setup
.PP
It can, however be run again by a user to update their config files
from a new version of sharpbang\-configs. In this case backups will be made
of any files which are overwritten.
.PP
If the user has already made extensive changes to their config files
it would be better to copy in new settings from skel by hand.
