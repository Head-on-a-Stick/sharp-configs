USAGE="sharp-user-setup: a script to populate a new user's HOME directory
using template files from /usr/share/sharpbang/skel

Normally this script is run automatically on a user's first login,
and inhibited after that by a flag file:
~/.config/sharpbang/sharp-setup

It can, however be run again by a user to update their config files
from a new version of sharpbang-configs. In this case backups will be made
of any files which are overwritten.

If the user has already made extensive changes to their config files
it would be better to copy in new settings from skel by hand.

Options:
-h --help
    Show this message.
--refresh
    Copy in any files in /usr/share/sharpbang/skel which are different
    from those in ~/. Overwritten files will be backed up.

it would be easier to check /usr/share/sharpbang/skel
